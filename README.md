# PriceAplication

This is an application to help you set prices for meals in a restaurant. It consists of two main parts: 

The first is "products" which contains tables with individual products (Product name, where was it bought, in what quantity (in grams), how much did it cost (in pounds) and how much does it cost a gram of this product)

The second part of the application is planned and will be presented at the meeting on Tuesday :)
